## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By contributing, you agree to uphold it.

---

## Project Rules

Before contributing, review [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the non-negotiable project rules:

- Do not use open-source runtime libraries. Use native browser APIs.
- Frontend and backend must work together — do not break the integration.
- Always update relevant markdown files alongside any code change.
- Do not add co-contributor AI or bot attribution to commits.

## Git Flow

This project uses Git Flow. All contributions must follow the branch model defined in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | Production-ready code only |
| `develop` | Integration branch for the next release |
| `feature/*` | New features, branched from `develop` |
| `release/*` | Release preparation, branched from `develop` |
| `hotfix/*` | Critical production fixes, branched from `main` |

### Steps

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a `feature/<short-description>` branch from `develop`.
3. Make your changes and commit with a clear message (see below).
4. Open a pull request targeting `develop`.

## Commit Messages

Use the conventional commit format:

```
<type>: <short summary>

<optional body>
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `style`, `test`, `chore`

**Examples:**

```
feat: add dark-mode accent picker to resume editor
fix: prevent cover letter PDF export from silently failing
docs: update CHANGELOG for v0.5.10
```

Rules:
- Use the imperative mood ("add", not "added")
- Keep the summary under 72 characters
- Do not include AI/bot co-author attribution
